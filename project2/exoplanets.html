            <h2>What are Exoplanets?</h2>
            <p>Exoplanets are planets that exist outside of our Solar System, orbiting stars other than the Sun. These planets can vary greatly in size, composition, and location, and some may even share similarities with Earth.</p>

            <h2>Types of Exoplanets</h2>
            <p>Exoplanets come in a variety of types, ranging from small, rocky planets similar to Earth, to massive gas giants similar to Jupiter. They can be classified as:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Earth-like Planets:</strong> Planets with rocky surfaces, similar in size to Earth, often found in the "habitable zone" of their stars.</li>
                <li><strong>Gas Giants:</strong> Large planets with thick atmospheres of hydrogen and helium, similar to Jupiter and Saturn.</li>
                <li><strong>Hot Jupiters:</strong> A type of gas giant that orbits very close to their parent stars, leading to extreme surface temperatures.</li>
                <li><strong>Ice Giants:</strong> Larger than Earth but smaller than gas giants, these planets have atmospheres primarily composed of ice and gas, like Uranus and Neptune.</li>
            </ul>

        <section id="famous-exoplanets" class="grid-item">
            <h2>Famous Exoplanets</h2>
            <p>Several exoplanets have been discovered that have garnered significant attention due to their unique characteristics:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Kepler-452b:</strong> Often referred to as "Earth's cousin," this exoplanet is located in the habitable zone of its star and may have liquid water.</li>
                <li><strong>Proxima b:</strong> The closest exoplanet to Earth, located around the star Proxima Centauri, potentially habitable.</li>
                <li><strong>HD 209458 b:</strong> A well-known "Hot Jupiter" exoplanet, famous for having its atmosphere studied by astronomers.</li>
